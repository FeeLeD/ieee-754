# ieee-754

Quite poor realization of program solving the binary and ieee-754 format simple operations: converting from decimal to binary or iee (depends on the type of input number) and adding two decimal numbers (positive/negative integers and only positive floats!). Using bitset for checking the result. Rest functions are written from scratch by using known algorithms of converting and adding.

NEEDS REFACTORING
